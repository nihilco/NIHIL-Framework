                  <p>This project is an application skeleton. You can use it to quickly bootstrap your jQuery webapp projects and dev environment for these projects.
                     <br>The seed app doesn\'t do much and has most of the feature removed so you can add theme as per your needs just following the demo app examples.</p>
