    <p>After twelve years of guiding students in India, Tim Williams created <strong>The Taraloka Foundation</strong> in 2012 as a way to assist the noble work of fellow guides and Tibetan locals, Kelsang Phuntsok and Gelek Gyatso.  Through their dedication and hard work, the Sikkim Happiness Home has become a place of safety, comfort, education, and love for more than 25 girls.</p>

    <h3>Basic structure of Taraloka:</h3>

        <ul>
    <li>26 girls in the Sikkim Happiness Home (four story home in Gangtok, Sikkim India)</li>
    <li>2 girls presently in college in Gangtok, Sikkim India (living in college dormitories) and one graduate seeking her Masters</li>
    <li>each girl has a sponsor in the USA ($2300 annually per girl)</li>
    <li>Beyond sponsorship funds, the Board of Directors raises about $25,000 annually for building maintenance, house needs, salaries, medical expenses, and creating more opportunities for the girls.
    </li>
    <li>3 employees in Sikkim (SHH coordinator, house mother, and cook)</li>
    <li>The girls attend an excellent private school in Gangtok, Sikkim India (Paljor Namgyl School)</li>
    <li>As soon as one girl leaves the SHH to live in a college dormitory, we find a sponsor and bring another young girl into the home.</li>
        </ul>
