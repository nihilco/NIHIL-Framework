    <p><strong>The Taraloka Foundation</strong> creates opportunities for Himalayan children by providing education, healthcare, and a safe refuge.</p>

    <p>We strive to do the best we can for a small group of girls in the Himalayan region of Sikkim. We take the girls from very difficult circumstance and support all of their needs until they graduate from college. As soon as one of our girls enters college, we have room to bring another girl into the Sikkim Happiness Home, their safe refuge. Some of our girls have been rescued from brothels. Others lost their parents and have no safety net. Some of our girls have a parent or a relative, but for a variety of reasons they need the safe refuge of the Sikkim Happiness Home. Regardless of the circumstance, our girls enjoy a life together as sisters. We help them cross over from a life of suffering to a life full of joy and potential.</p>
